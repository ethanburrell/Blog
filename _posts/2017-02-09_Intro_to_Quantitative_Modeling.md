# Introduction to Quantitative Modeling (Part 1)
### What is a model?
A model in simple terms is the relationship between some variables.
Models attempt to simplify the real world and guess the outcome of an action
through mathematical equations and probability. Guessing is the key word here,
models use statistics paired with some basic math to create a prediction of what
*could* happen next.

This post will list some popular models for real-life events.

Examples of models:
  * The weight of gold brick gives price of of the brick.
  * The spread of the flu over the flu season.
  * The relationship of demand and price of the newest iPhone.
  * How quickly a trend, say fidget spinners, will saturate the market.

### Price of Gold

As you can see, the relationship between the weight of gold and its price is roughly linear.
This line is a good predictor. At this time the price of gold is $1,318.25, so this plot is
a very good predictor.

This model can be used to calculate an output: "How much will a 10 ounce brick of gold cost?"

### Spread of Flu

As you can see this function grows quickly actually at an exponential rate.

This model is excellent for forecasting which is useful for determining demand
of flu medicine and doctors visits.

"How many people will be sick in 2 weeks?"

"How many shipments of NyQuil should Vicks send to this city?"

### Demand of the iPhone 9S

IMAGE HERE
This graph shows the relationship between Price of the iPhone and the Quantity that
is demanded by consumers. At a very low price many people want iPhones, but at a low
price the Quantity Demanded drops significantly.

This type of plot is used for optimization, deciding what price (and then demand) will
create the largest profit for the company.

### Saturation of Fidget Spinners

This model shows how saturation generally works in a market.

Companies use this for forecasting and targeting.

"When should the company begin to ramp up production of Fidget Spinners?"

"When should the company buy resources for production?"

# The Modeling Process

Models are commonly used as a decision support tool, picking the correct model for
the problem at had is difficult.

After creating and fitting the model, if it does not output a meaningful analysis,
then we go back to Formulating the model and try to tweak constants or change the
type of model.

The model may not always work because the real world is always changing, tweaking models
is a must.
