# Dollars and Sense (2017)
## How we misthink money and how to spend smarter
### Dan Ariely and Jeff Kreisler
ISBN 9780062651204

__My Picks__

> *The way we **should** think about the opportunity cost of money is that when we spend money on one thing, it's money that we cannot spend on something else, neither right now nor anytime later.* (9)

---

> *Which question would we answer more quickly and decisively: "What do you want for dinner?" or "Do you want chicken or pizza for dinner?"* (33)

He makes the comparison that with sales, when we are given relative informaiton it helps us makes our decision. Most people would rather buy a $100 dollar shirt for $60 then a regular $60 dollar shirt. In the case of stores like JC Penny, these are the same shirts.

---

>*One of the most interesting characteristics of the way we classify our financial decisions relates to the mental account into which we put a purchase, and the feelings we have about it, which often have to do with the amount of time between when we bought it and when we consumed it, rather than the actual value of the item.* (57)

Example is used for wine. When we buy an expensive bottle of wine and age it, it is seen as an "investment." We greatly enjoy the bottle of wine later with the fancy experience of saving it and then drinking it years later. No money was spent on the fine wine that evening, it was an investment made long ago. This can also be said with pre-paying for a trip vs paying after (the former feels easier for us).

Happens after a studying on entertainment, on prepayment vs postpayment (page 73/74)

> *Prepaying isn't just a trend, it's all around us. We buy Broadway tickets, airfare, and Burning Man passes well before we use them. Heck, you paid for this book before you consumed it. *

> *If we pay for something before consuming it, the actual consumption of it feels almost painless. There is no pain of paying at that time nor any worrying about paying in the future. It is a pain free transaction*
(75)

Story about an app forcing a user to pay to continue to use the app.
> *What happens when we try and use this marvelous app and a message pops up informing us that, from now on, if we want to use the app, we must pay a one-time charge of 99 cents? Do we pay a dollar to use something we love? Or do we see if we can find a similar thing for free, even if it does't work as well? A dollar is clearly is not a lot in the scheme of things... We don't hesitate to pay $4 every day for a latte, but a $1 for an app that used to be free? Outrageous. (87)

Splitting the bill, who feels it the most?

When one person pays for the whole bill the net unhappiness is at it's highest

Listing Price affects perceived price. This happened with a house in Arizona.

> *Agents who were told the listing price was $119k estimated that the home was worth $111k, A listing price of $129k netted an estimated purchase price of $123k. A listing price of $139k led to $124k, and $149k caused the experts to estimate the value of the house at $127k. In other words the higher the listing price, the higher the estimated price.* (94)

---
Affects of Anchoring

>*Think about sitting at a fancy restaurant looking at a well-designed menu. What do we see first> The luxurious lobster kobe beef delight for $125. That's not what we want, or what we get, but it serves to anchor our perspective on the value of other items on the menu, to make everything else seem affordable by comparison.* (101)

---
Virtual ownership

> *Imagine we bid on a Mickey Mouse watch on eBay. Its near the end of the auction and we're the highest bidder. We start imaginign owning and using the product -- and we are often quite upset if someone swoops in at the last second to outbid us. That's virtual ownership.* (118)

---
On Fairness and Effort

> *Similarly, people dont' feel bad about downloading illegal music and movies for free because they reason that all the effort of producing them took place in the past, and a download does not create any additional effort or cost on the producer's part. (why anti-piracy campaigns focus the harm on the artists.)* (143)

Sometimes when selling services on the Internet, you want to some how show that we are doing work (maybe by a loading wheel p144)

On Enhancing Consumption
> *Enjoyment of something comes from both the sensation of the thing-- the tase of the food, the speed of the car, the sound of a song -- and what is happening in in our brain to co-create the total experience of it. We can call this the full consumption service. (p 150)*
---
>*The rituals we undertake during consumption make the experience special. We own it more; it becomes a greater investment, one that is more entangled in our own lives and experience. We also get a greater sense of control through rituals. An activity becomes familiar. It becomes our own when we ritualize it. We are in command. That adds value, too. (165)*
---

Emotional Definition
> *Much of what makes us so emotionally detached from our future selves is the fact that our future selves are so poorly defined. We often imagine our future selves to be entirely different people than our present selves. We understand and feel and connect to our current needs and desires much more than our future ones. (p 188)*

---

> *Why are we so foolish? Because of these emotional factors -- our inability to delay gratification, the uncertainty of dying from texting while driving, and our overconfidence in our ability to avoid def. We continue to be "perfect people" in the future, but that text is now.* (190)

> *When it comes to spending -- and therefore not saving -- the temptations are almost constant. We assume no ones needs a primer on our culture of consumption, but just in case, turn on the TV, go online, read a magazine, or walk through a mall and feel the temptation.* (190)

---

> *Prices shouldn't affect value, performance, or pleasure -- but they do. We are trained to make quick decisions based on money with every single transaction, especially in the absence of other value markers, that's what we do* (200)

---

> *We often focus on money as an approximation of our live's value. When we stop to think about it, we know that money isn't the most important thing in life. No one ever lies on their deathbed wishing they'd spend more time with their money. But because money is much easier to measure -- and less frightening to consider-- then whatever the meaning of life might be, we can focus on it instead.* (p 205)

---

What does not matter (for our purchasing decisions) in a perfectly rational world:

* Sales prices or "savings" or how much we're spending at the same time on something else

* The classification of our money (mental accounting)

* The ease of payment

* The first price we see or previous prices we've paid for a purchase (anchoring)

* Our sense of ownership

* whether someone appears to have worked hard

* weather we give into temptations of the present

* the ease of comparing the price of a product, experience or widget

(p 214)

---

Valuation mistake that we make (pg 216)
* Ignore opportunity costs
* forget everything is relarive

A Tip:

> *Talking with our future selves is one useful step toward shifting our thinking and building more willpower to resist the temptation of now.* 229

> *A Ulysses contract is any arrangement by which we create barriers against future tempation. We give ourselves no choice; we eliminate free will.* 230

(Ulysses tied himself to a ship to hear the sirens sing)

> *What if ew took that binding and punishment further and created a discipline bank with a dominatrix as a logo? This bank would take every possible money decision out of our hands. Our Employer would send our check to the discipline bank. The bank would pay our bills and we'd get a weekly allowance. The money would be restricted. We couldn't do whatever we wanted with it, it would be set aside for specific usage, and the bank manager could change the rules as he or she saw fit.*
